<div class='post-body'>

<p>One can profitably think of just about any area of human endeavor as a collection of conversations. (I hope one can do this anyway, because that's what I'm going to do.)</p>

<p>We have conversations about agriculture, for example. We talk about crop rotation or whether or not to invest in a combine or about the history of farming. We have conversations about banking&mdash;mortgages, savings accounts, "too big to fail"&mdash;and conversations about, say, particle physics or infrastructure or unemployment or colonization or race relations or evolution or philosophy or the price of gas. Human existence is, in a very real way, this buzzing of a billion billion conversations, between and among others, with the thoughts of strangers and those long dead, and with ourselves.</p>

<p>And education is, to my mind, one such set of conversations, arranged to prepare young people for all the other ones. It is a type of conversation specifically designed to enable its participants to <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>understand</span> and <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>contribute to</span> the other valuable and productive conversations that make up our&mdash;and will make up their&mdash;brief, buzzing existences.</p>

<p class='h2-sec'>More Meta</p>

<p>We have conversations about conversations too. (We're doing it right now!) And when we have a conversation about the conversation that is education, there is often a tension surrounding these "understand" and "contribute to" functions I mentioned, with some people emphasizing more of the former and others more of the latter. If you're familiar with this meta-conversation, it doesn't take you long at all to figure out which of these two educational goals is being emphasized over the other. Take <a href='https://www.aft.org/periodical/american-educator/spring-2006/how-knowledge-helps' target='_blank'>this</a>, for example:</p>

<blockquote>An obvious way in which knowledge aids the acquisition of more knowledge lies in the greater power it affords in making correct inferences. If the writer assumes that you have some background knowledge that you lack, you'll be confused. For example, if you read, "He was a real Benedict Arnold about it" and you don't know who Benedict Arnold was, you're lost. This implication of background knowledge is straightforward and easy to grasp. It is no surprise, then, that the ability to read a text and make sense of it is highly correlated with background knowledge (Kosmoski, Gay, and Vockell, 1990). If you know more, you're a better reader.</blockquote>

<p>This clearly emphasizes the goal of "understanding"; the author even uses the imagery of a person confused (or not) in a "conversation" with a piece of writing. Compare that to <a href='https://www.youcubed.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/teacher-article-youcubed2.pdf target='_blank'>this quotation</a>, which places a great deal of emphasis on learners' contributions to the conversation of education:</p>

<blockquote>If we are serious about encouraging students to develop growth mindsets we need to provide open tasks that have the space within them for learning, not short tasks that students are meant to get right or wrong. Tasks are made more open when they have or encourage:
<ul>
<li style='margin-bottom:15px;'>Multiple entry points</li>
<li style='margin-bottom:15px;'>Multiple ways of seeing</li>
<li style='margin-bottom:15px;'>Multiple pathways and strategies for solutions</li>
</ul>

The research on mindset and the research showing the importance of mistakes both suggest strongly that we need math environments in which students are given open tasks and challenging work that causes them to struggle, experience cognitive conflict and make mistakes. Teachers should support or even reward students for making mistakes so that they feel comfortable doing so.</blockquote>

<p>Here we have "open tasks," "struggle," "make mistakes." There is "space" for learning rather than content for learning (as in the quote from Willingham), because students' contributions are given primary importance in the piece.</p>

<p>Consider two more quotations, one which emphasizes the goal of student "understanding" of those conversations outside of school, and one which stresses the goal of students' ultimately "contributing" to those conversations&mdash;from different sources, but both from <a href='https://edexcellence.net/articles/creative-schools' target='_blank'>the same article.</a> Here the difference between the two emphases is much starker. It is not hard at all to tell which is which.</p>

<blockquote style='margin-bottom:40px;'>"One of the declared aims of public education is to provide all students, whatever their backgrounds and circumstances, with opportunities to prosper and succeed and to become active and engaged citizens."</blockquote>

<blockquote style='margin-bottom:40px;'>From time immemorial, schools have existed to transmit—consciously and unconsciously—the language, knowledge, and values of their societies at any given time and place.</blockquote>

<p class='h2-sec'>Analyses Are Always Simplifying, and Dichotomies Are not Always False</p>

<p>Naturally, the dichotomy I've outlined around other people's words here sands down many of the real edges and complexities of this collective conversation, and it ignores the ideological spectra even within like-minded groups who participate in it. But I hope you can see that it fits, roughly. And I hope that you can persuade yourself, too, that it is inevitable. Just as it is difficult to listen and speak at the same time, it is difficult to talk about listening and speaking at the same time. And that's what we're talking about (again, roughly)&mdash;on the one hand, students' listening in conversations and absorbing the knowledge that will prepare them to be successful citizens, and on the other, students' actively engaging in conversations and building the generative skills that will . . . wait for it . . . prepare them to be successful citizens.</p>

<p>We presume too often, I think, that sticking with just one of these two goals will magically poof the other one into existence. Knowledge and explicit instruction is my mantra, for example&mdash;as I sometimes forget that the student's feelings of ownership over that knowledge in order to carry it out into the world will not just magically appear. "Meaningful engagement" is another mantra&mdash;and students' technical know-how is presumed to somehow mysteriously and ineluctably follow. My sense is that we should give up on the idea that focusing on just listening or just speaking (just understanding or just contributing) will make the other one appear. It won't.
