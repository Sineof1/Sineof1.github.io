<p>I really liked <a href='https://mathmindsblog.wordpress.com/2015/08/04/a-teacher-mathematician-mash-up/' target='_blank'>this post over at Math Minds</a>&mdash;a site I've liked enough to link in the little collapsible sidebar to the right. One reason I like Kristin's writing is that it seems to be tightly focused on the content as the centerpiece around which everything else swirls. Even her <a href='https://www.shadowmathcon.com/kristin-gray/' target='_blank'>talk at NCTM this year</a> featured this content-centric "call to action":</p>

<blockquote>Start a personal math journal and record things you learn and/or curiosities you have around the content you are currently teaching. These curiosities can be your own or ones gained through observations of student talk and/or work. After two weeks of recording in the journal, share a moment(s) that inspired you to be be [sic] more curious and describe how it impacted the teaching and learning in your classroom through student work samples and descriptive text.</blockquote>

<p>It's good stuff all around, pleasingly and noticeably devoid of mathematically arid, pseudo-pedagogical <a href='https://skepdic.com/woowoo.html' target='_blank'>woo-woo</a>. Yet this snippet, from the post mentioned above, gets my dander up (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>The task centers around the commutative property of multiplication with fractions in the context of wrapping packages with ribbon, \(\mathtt{6 \times \frac{2}{3}}\) and \(\mathtt{\frac{2}{3} \times 6}\). In my classroom, <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>I am so wary of students strictly computing without making sense of problems</span> that I make a conscious effort, probably to almost an extreme, to connect their representations to a context.</blockquote>

<p>Before I question this wariness, I should say that I get it. It happens in curriculum design too. You get your head down inside a problem or activity that you write to be problematic for students (not necessarily contextual; you just want a majority of them to be confused enough to have a small mathematical epiphany), and then someone else takes a look and points out how a student will game it using a memorized algorithm. Back to the drawing board.</p>

<p class='h2-sec'>Driven by Fear?</p>
<p>Yet I also get the "extreme" that Kristin mentions, and that's what I question here (noting that she is avoiding this in her own practice&mdash;I'm not attacking anyone's teaching). In my line of work, this extreme presents itself as writing problems or activities not with the intent that students will make sense of the mathematics, but with the intent that students will not "strictly compute" and that <strong>this is the same thing as making sense of the mathematics</strong>.</p>

<p>I think we all get, intellectually, that those two things are not necessarily the same, but it seems like something easy to forget. Or, rather, it is, ironically, a perspective about creating lesson material that can be applied blindly, procedurally, algorithmically: just take a standard school mathematics problem or activity, and make sure students <strong>can't</strong> complete it "normally." Voil&agrave;, sense-making! And, for free, perseverance.</p>

<p>Does everyone do this? No. Do some people do this? No doubt. "Mindless" computation and the human brain&mdash;the kind you own&mdash;go together like <a href='https://www.enlightenmenteconomics.com/blog/index.php/2011/11/thinking-fast-and-slow-and-thinking-hard/' target='_blank'>peas and carrots</a>.</p>

<p>Lately I've been more interested in methods which roll with students' tendencies to <a href='https://schoolofdoubt.com/2015/03/08/you-cannot-not-have-conceptual-understanding/' target='_blank'>focus on attenuated meanings rather than the meanings we want them to have</a>, methods which attempt to parasitize such computational tendencies from the inside out. In general, though, the idea I try to keep in mind is that this kind of thinking from students is perfectly normal and can be shaped to do good in the world.</p>
