<p>I caught a very brief back-and-forth on Twitter the other day&mdash;actually, Amazon's <a href='http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=11448061011'>"Prime Day,"</a> July 15&mdash;wherein mathematician author Jordan Ellenberg <a href='https://twitter.com/JSEllenberg/status/621345520682946560' target='_blank'>jokingly wondered</a> why it was called "Prime Day" when 15 wasn't a prime.</p>

<p>One of the replies suggested that it was "Grothendieck Prime" Day, which led me to <a href='http://math.fau.edu/richman/Interesting/WebSite/Number57.pdf' target='_blank'>this</a>:

<blockquote>The number 57 is sometimes called a "Grothendieck prime", after the prodigious mathematician Alexandre Grothendieck who is alleged to have said 57 when asked to give an example of a specific prime.</blockquote>

<p>Which also reminded me of this in an interview with Stephen Colbert and Terence Tao, where Tao ever so briefly begins to suggest that 27 is prime (at around 2:50 where he talks a bit about twin primes).</p>

<p>And 27 certainly has a little "priminess" to it. Not as much as 57 I would say, mostly because 27 is featured as a product in a "basic multiplication fact," but I get it. So maybe "Colbert Prime" for 27. "Tao Prime" might be too confusing, even for mathematicians.</p>
