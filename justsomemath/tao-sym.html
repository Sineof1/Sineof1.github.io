<div class='post-body'>

<p>After reading <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/magazine/the-singular-mind-of-terry-tao.html' target='_blank'>this piece</a> about mathematician Terence Tao, I was turned on to <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Solving-Mathematical-Problems-Personal-Perspective/dp/0199205604' target='_blank'>a book</a> about mathematical problem-solving Tao wrote as a 15-year-old, so I decided to check it out. The book contains a nice little nugget about symmetry in the first chapter, the importance of which sails by the author (and thus the reader) a bit, I think. Here's the problem:</p>

<blockquote>A triangle has its lengths in an arithmetic progression, with difference \(\mathtt{d}\). The area of the triangle is \(\mathtt{t}\). Find the lengths and angles of the triangle.</blockquote>

<p>And here's the nice move with regard to symmetry that Tao makes, almost in passing. It doesn't seem to be a "code-cracking" idea in the context of the problem, but I think it highlights a key process in mathematical thinking that we can work to make more explicit for students. It might be helpful to tinker with the problem a little to put this move in some context:</p>

<blockquote>We can use the data to simplify the notation: we know that the sides are in arithmetic progression, so instead of \(\mathtt{a}\), \(\mathtt{b}\), and \(\mathtt{c}\), we can have \(\mathtt{a}\), \(\mathtt{a + d}\), and \(\mathtt{a + 2d}\) instead. But the notation can be even better if we make it more symmetrical, by making the side lengths \(\mathtt{b - d}\), \(\mathtt{b}\), and \(\mathtt{b + d}\).</blockquote>

<p>I can easily imagine, given what I know about most current curricula, a student writing down the side lengths of the triangle as \(\mathtt{a}\), \(\mathtt{a + d}\), and \(\mathtt{a + 2d}\), because this is how we teach arithmetic progressions. But we don't often explicitly make the fairly simple observation that any term, with the exception of the first, in an arithmetic progression can be written as \(\mathtt{a_n}\), with the previous term written as \(\mathtt{a_n - d}\) and the next term as \(\mathtt{a_n + d}\). It seems that we can find this observation by thinking a bit more about symmetry when we craft our explanations and instruction.</p>

<p class='h2-sec'>Another Observation</p>

<p>Working to orient oneself to the symmetries available in mathematical situations seems like one appropriate remedy to what I call <a href='http://textsavvy.blogspot.com/2014/07/measuring-misconceptions.html' target='_blank'>"left-to-rightism," or "cinemathematics"</a>&mdash;a syndrome that makes us teach concepts like <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9y9PCgl63o-TG55UEl2Y1JXRjQ/view?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>the equals sign</a> (unwittingly) in a left-to-right way, such that students take away (unwittingly) the misconception that the equals sign indicates that some answer is to follow, rather than that two expressions are equal. Some <a href='https://plus.google.com/+JoshuaFisherD/posts/LHTBz3qDR3D' target='_blank'>recent research</a> points to the benefits of thinking about symmetry when teaching negative numbers as well.</p>
