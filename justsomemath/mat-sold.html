<div class='post-body'>

<p>It's still weird to me how repetitive, in general, the messaging is about mathematics learning. Almost never, in the 20 years I've been paying attention at least, does a journalist stick a microphone or scribble in a notepad in front of some high profile person's face and not get this quote about math almost verbatim:</p>

<blockquote>It could be that maybe the way math is sold, in some sense, is one in which it's just a bunch of formulas to memorize. I think if we are able to communicate to the greater American public that mathematics is not just about memorizing a bunch of formulas, but in fact is as creative as the humanities and arts, quite possibly you might be able to upend the culture difference.</blockquote>

<p>In this case, the person on the other end of the microphone was Po-Shen Loh, the head coach of <a href='https://www.npr.org/2015/07/18/424122249/theyre-no-1-u-s-wins-math-olympiad-for-first-time-in-21-years' target='_blank'>the 2015 winning U.S. Math Olympiad team</a> and founder of <a href='https://www.expii.com/' target='_blank'>Expii.com</a>, which describes itself as "a collection of free, interactive, explanations written by people from around the world."</p>

<p>If you are at all familiar with mainstream education chatter, though, then a glance at the sparse but really nice content at Expii&mdash;if not merely at the quotation in the paragraph above&mdash;will tell you that people have very different answers to the problem of making mathematics a creative discipline for students. And to the extent that interactive explanation is a big part of Loh's answer, I'm in complete agreement with him.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Another <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/magazine/the-singular-mind-of-terry-tao.html' target='_blank'>example</a>, from Terence Tao, being liked, thumbs-upped, plus-oned, and otherwise endorsed without skepticism, since it hits that "deeper meaning" inspirational note we so desperately long for:</p>

<blockquote>Tao now believes that his younger self, the prodigy who wowed the math world, wasn’t truly doing math at all. "It’s as if your only experience with music were practicing scales or learning music theory," he said, looking into light pouring from his window. "I didn’t learn the deeper meaning of the subject until much later."</blockquote>

<p>You probably won't see the next quote from the article making the rounds, though, since this emphasizes the huge "knowledge" and understanding part where all that "deeper meaning" came from:</p>

<blockquote>For their work, Tao and Green salvaged a crucial bit from an earlier proof done by others, which had been discarded as incorrect, and aimed at a different goal. Other maneuvers came from masterful proofs by Timothy Gowers of England and Endre Szemeredi of Hungary. Their work, in turn, relied on contributions from Erdos, Klaus Roth and Frank Ramsey, an Englishman who died at age 26 in 1930, and on and on, into history.</blockquote>

<p>I find the latter quote profoundly more inspirational&mdash;it shows that the work we do builds on that of others, alive and dead, incrementally; it is not, even for geniuses like Terence Tao, a matter of being exposed alone to "deeper meaning."</p>
