<div class='post-body'>

<p>I was reminded of an interesting distinction reading <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Very-Short-Introduction-Introductions-ebook/dp/B0141CMYD8/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=' target='_blank'>this book</a>. Rewording into a question the key quote:</p>

<blockquote>If global warming led to an increase in the atmospheric temperature by 2Â°C, what would this represent as an increase in degrees Fahrenheit?</blockquote>

<p>There is a nice tension in this question for students in the middle of 9th grade, who have done so much linear work now they try to shoehorn everything into a linear equation and graph. I can imagine a student at first trying to wrestle with \(\mathtt{F(C) = \frac{9}{5}C + 32}\) to figure this out.</p>

<p>This isn't "wrong," necessarily. It's just that we don't need the whole equation. We just need the slope. This isn't a trick of perspective that results in the same calculation. It's a different calculation than if we found the corresponding temperature in degrees Fahrenheit from the temp in degrees Celsius, say, 2&deg;C.</p>

<p>There, of course, we would use the whole equation:</p><p>\(\mathtt{F(2) = \frac{9}{5}(2) + 32 = 35.6}\).</p>

<p>But the change is constant up and down the line, so a change of positive 2&deg;C is just:</p><p>\(\mathtt{\frac{9}{5} \times 2 = 3.6}\).</p>

<p>We just multiply by the slope.</p>

<p class='h2-sec'>Explaining the Meaning of Parts of an Equation</p>

<p>This is a nice distinction, I think, even in late middle school when students are first wrapping their heads around linear relationships in the abstract. We often ask students to explain the meanings of different parts of an equation. It seems appropriate to show them that one part of a linear equation, the slope, is all we need to answer certain kinds of questions. This kind of change question is all over the place in middle school and high school, in different forms.</p>

<p>In my experience, most middle school (8) and high school math courses get at this distinction&mdash;between determining an output value given an input value and determining the rate of change. But I don't recall ever seeing something like the above, which shows you that determining "meaning" has reciprocal effects on mathematical ideas.</p>
