<p>I first encountered the notion of <strong>threshold concepts</strong> in David Didau's marvelous book <a href='http://www.amazon.com/What-Everything-About-Education-Wrong/dp/1845909631' target='_blank'>What If Everything You Knew About Education Was Wrong?</a> He provides links there to <a href='https://plus.google.com/+JoshuaFisherD/posts/3oQAjXPFY22' target='_blank'>this article</a>, by Jan Meyer and Ray Land&mdash;who first wrote about threshold concepts&mdash;and <a href='https://plus.google.com/+JoshuaFisherD/posts/bTYU4SeVAFa' target='_blank'>this one</a>, by Glynis Cousin, which provides a briefer introduction to the idea. Meyer and Land describe threshold concepts this way:</p>

<blockquote>A threshold concept can be considered as akin to a portal, opening up a new and previously inaccessible way of thinking about something. It represents a transformed way of understanding, or interpreting, or viewing something without which the learner cannot progress. As a consequence of comprehending a threshold concept there may thus be a transformed internal view of subject matter, subject landscape, or even world view. This transformation may be sudden or it may be protracted over a considerable period of time, with the transition to understanding proving troublesome.</blockquote>

<p>Reading this, I recall my freshman year in college, when I took a lot of 101 courses: Anthropology 101, Biology 101 (I think it was 150 actually), even Theology 101 (though I'm quite sure it wasn't called that). What I enjoyed about these courses&mdash;though even then I was certain that I was not going to be a biologist, anthropologist, or theologian&mdash;was that they delivered these "previously inaccessible way[s] of thinking about something."</p>

<p>Sure, I had some ideas about the world that fell within the purview of each of these fields&mdash;some ideas about how human societies function, how the human body functions, and some ideas about how we collectively think gods get their work done. But it was clearly not a goal in these courses to stretch my previous or intuitive understandings into something more mature and rigorous. What was intended was a welcoming into an academic community&mdash;a community that looked at the world in a specific set of ways that had served it well over the decades or centuries; one that had developed useful schemas and language for investigating the specific slice of the universe that interested it; one that had essentially constructed, at its boundaries and deeper within, <strong>threshold concepts</strong> which initiates had to come to terms with in order to navigate and contribute to the community; and one which&mdash;and this seems like a characteristic of academic communities that is often overlooked by K&ndash;12 education&mdash;continuously reinforces and overturns these concepts through free and transparent criticism and debate.</p>

<p>I highly recommend the more detailed exposition given at the links above.</p>
