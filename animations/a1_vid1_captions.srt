1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
In this course, you're going to be

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,000
talking a lot, a LOT about relationships.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,390
No, not that kind of relationship, sorry.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,440
We're going to be talking about

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,960
relationships between quantities.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,470
Yeah, like that.

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,790
A graph is one way to show a

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,810
relationship between two quantities.

9
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,340
In this case, the graph shows that the

10
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,619
elevation of a skier goes down over time.

11
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:27,130
In other words, as the quantity "time"

12
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,560
increases, the quantity "elevation"

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,310
decreases.

14
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,910
The two quantities here have specific names.

15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,010
The elevation of the skier depends on

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,680
the time, so elevation in this situation

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,130
is called the dependent quantity.

18
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,660
And time is called the independent

19
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,000
quantity.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,860
This line represents a trip down

21
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,860
a ski slope.

22
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,990
But the line also has something called slope.

23
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,970
Do you remember what slope is?

24
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,410
How would you describe the slope of this

25
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,969
line?
