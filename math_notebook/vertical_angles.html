<h1>Why Did Someone Ever Call These "Vertical" Angles?</h1>

<article>
<section id="Introduction">
<center><iframe scrolling="no" 

src="https://tube.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/290397/width/900/height/501/border/ffffff/rc/false/ai/false/sdz/true/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/true/ld

/true/sri/false/at/preferhtml5" width="900px" height="501px" style="border:0px; margin-top:-30px;"> </iframe></center>

<p>The Vertical Angle Theorem, or Proposition 15 in Euclid's <em>Elements</em>, is one of my favorites, because of its simplicity. You can produce two 

angles which are exactly equal in measure simply by drawing two intersecting straight lines. Even better, you draw two pairs of congruent angles 

whenever you simply draw two straight intersecting lines. Of course, "simply" is a bit of an understatement. You have to draw two perfectly straight, 

one-dimensional lines, but other than that, it's cake. (And I suppose those two lines should intersect in just one point. Or does that matter?) The 

angles in each pair that are congruent are called vertical angles.</p>

<p>The name has to do with the "vertex" sense of "vertical" instead of the "up and down" sense. <a href='http://sineof1.github.io/math_notebook/sas.html' target='blank'>Heath</a> 

explains, by way of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclus' target='blank'>Proclus</a>, the difference between vertical angles and adjacent 

angles (today, we would call these adjacent angles a linear pair). I've highlighted the part which clarifies the naming of vertical angles:</p>
<div id='blockquote'><img src='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-smIooyGzTck/VSgrsJU5LFI/AAAAAAAASOE/BNueS8a4MW4/w753-h809-no/vertadj_angle.gif' 

width='300px' style='float:right; margin-top:10px; margin-left:15px;' />
The first term describes the angles made by two straight lines when one only is divided by the other, i.e., when one straight line meets another at a 

point which is not either of its extremities, but is not itself produced beyond the point of meeting. When the first straight line <em>is</em> 

produced, so that the lines cross at the point, they make two pairs of <em>vertical</em> angles <mark>(which are more clearly described as 

<em>vertically opposite</em> angles), and which are so called because their convergence is from opposite directions to one point (the intersection of 

the lines) as vertex.</mark></div>

<h2>But the Proof Relies on "Adjacent Angles," a.k.a. Linear Pairs</h2>

<p>The proof that vertical angles are congruent makes use of Proposition 13, which is a proof that the angles in a linear pair (the so-called adjacent 

angles) have measures that add up to \(\small\mathtt{180^\circ}\). Let's just assume that Proposition 13 is true for now and see how it is applied in 

Euclid's proof of the Vertical Angle Theorem.</p>
<div id='blockquote'><img src='https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OA6OrpDT9-s/VSgrsRsal7I/AAAAAAAASOI/3XGimYs-yz4/w205-h132-no/verts.gif' 

style='float:right; margin-left:15px; margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:50px; margin-right:15px;' />
For let the straight lines \(\small\mathtt{AB}\), \(\small\mathtt{CD}\) cut one another at the point \(\small\mathtt{E}\); I say that the angle 

\(\small\mathtt{AEC}\) is equal to the angle \(\small\mathtt{DEB}\), and the angle \(\small\mathtt{CEB}\) to the angle \(\small\mathtt{AED}\). 

<mark>For, since the straight line \(\small\mathtt{AE}\) stands on the straight line \(\small\mathtt{CD}\), making the angles \(\small\mathtt{CEA}\), 

\(\small\mathtt{AED}\), the angles \(\small\mathtt{CEA}\), \(\small\mathtt{AED}\) are equal to two right angles. Again, since the straight line 

\(\small\mathtt{DE}\) stands on the straight line \(\small\mathtt{AB}\), making the angles \(\small\mathtt{AED}\), \(\small\mathtt{DEB}\), the angles 

\(\small\mathtt{AED}\), \(\small\mathtt{DEB}\) are equal to two right angles.</mark></div>

<p>The section highlighted shows two applications of Proposition 13, or what most would call the Linear Pair Postulate today. It just lets us say that 

those angles mentioned in the quotation are supplementary. It's interesting that Euclid uses "straight line" to describe both a ray and a line, and 

note that "two right angles" is used instead of what we would substitute with "a straight angle." This has to do with Euclid's definition of 

<em>angle</em> (Definition 1.8): "A plane angle is the inclination to one another of two lines in a plane which meet one another and do not lie in a 

straight line."</p>

<div id='blockquote'><img src='https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OA6OrpDT9-s/VSgrsRsal7I/AAAAAAAASOI/3XGimYs-yz4/w205-h132-no/verts.gif' 

style='float:right; margin-left:15px; margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:50px; margin-right:15px;' />
But the angles \(\small\mathtt{CEA}\), \(\small\mathtt{AED}\) were also proved equal to two right angles; therefore the angles \(\small\mathtt{CEA}\), 

\(\small\mathtt{AED}\) are equal to the angles \(\small\mathtt{AED}\), \(\small\mathtt{DEB}\).<br><br>
Let the angle \(\small\mathtt{AED}\) be subtracted from each; therefore the remaining angle \(\small\mathtt{CEA}\) is equal to the remaining angle 

\(\small\mathtt{BED}\). Similarly it can be proved that the angles \(\small\mathtt{CEB}\), \(\small\mathtt{DEA}\) are also equal. Therefore etc.</div>

<p>Once we get that \(\measuredangle\small\mathtt{CEA}\) + \(\measuredangle\small\mathtt{AED}\) = \(\measuredangle\small\mathtt{AED}\) + 

\(\measuredangle\small\mathtt{DEB}\), then we subtract \(\measuredangle\small\mathtt{AED}\) from both sides of the equation to see that the remaining 

angles are congruent. Rinse and repeat from the beginning for the other pair of vertical angles.</p>

<h2>Assumptions and Questions</h2>
<a href='https://flic.kr/p/eEvRmb' target='blank'><img id='imgnorm' src='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eGSHrBqpCM4/VSXiLuvkyLI/AAAAAAAASAk/7oki-

<p>We see in the last part of the proof the use of Postulate 4 ("That all right angles are equal to one another"), Common Notion 1 ("Things which are 

equal to the same thing are also equal to one another"), and Common Notion 3 ("If equals be subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal"). What's 

missing is some assurance that no matter how I draw the two straight lines that intersect at a point, I can still do this proof.</p>
