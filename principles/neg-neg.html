<p>I was happy to see (I think, again) <a href='http://commoncoretools.me/2015/07/13/essays-from-the-noyce-dana-project-clarifying-the-mathematical-underpinnings-of-secondary-school/' target='_blank'>these essays</a> by 10 mathematicians, including Bill McCallum, one of the lead writers of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSS-M), addressing the "mathematical underpinnings of secondary school mathematics in the United States."</p>

<p>The timing is certainly right for me as I try to refocus some energy back into content. Here is what Mr McCallum had to say about these essays:</p>

<blockquote>There are many resources available to both pre-service and in-service teachers to help them increase their content knowledge in a way directly related to how they teach. Still, there are areas of mathematical content, relevant to the core of the mathematics curriculum, that somehow fail to receive systematic treatment in any of these resources. For many teachers, this means that there are always nagging questions that go unanswered. These teachers experience mathematics as a subject that somehow never fully makes sense.</blockquote>

<p>So this was a not-all-that interesting problem to me. I'll admit to having looked up the "answer" after getting nowhere with it for a whileâ€”I started down the brute-force path that was laid out in the Answers section but turned around too early, fully convinced that I was on the wrong path.</p>

<p>It's completely sloppy and inelegant, but it's what I could work out on paper as a first step to locating where the perpendiculars intersected the non-horizontal lines of the triangle. I needed those locations in order to know where to draw the colorful lines on the perimeter.</p>

<p>The downside, of course, is that everyone needs to know a little programming first, before we can use it as an environment in which to play out mathematics learning. And that's hard.</p>
