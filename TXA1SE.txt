Skiers seek  
soft, freshly fallen  
snow because it gives a  
smooth “floating” ride. Of  
course, the ride up the  
mountain isn’t nearly as much  
fun—especially if the ski  
lifts are on  
the fritz!

A  
person who weighs 100 pounds on Ear th would weigh only about 40 pounds on 
the planet Mercur y and about 91 pounds on Venus. In fact, there are only three  
planets in our solar system where a 100-pound person would weigh more than 100 
pounds: Jupiter, Satur n, and Neptune. On Satur n, a 100-pound person would weigh 
about 106 pounds, on Neptune, about 113 pounds, and on Jupiter, about 236 pounds! 
On Pluto——which is no longer considered a planet—–a 100-pound person would 
weigh less than 7 pounds.
But what if a 100-pound person could stand on the sur face of the Sun? If that were 
possible, then that person would weigh over 2700 pounds! More than a ton! What 
causes these differences in weight?

ow interesting would a website be without pictures or illustrations? Does an 
inviting image on a magazine cover make you more likely to buy it? Pictures  
and images aren’t just for drawing your attention, though. They also bring life to text 
and stories.
There is an old proverb that states that a picture is wor th a thousand words. There is 
a lot of tr uth in this saying—and images have been used by humans for a long time to 
communicate. Just think: would you rather post a stor y of your adventure on a social

Problem  1   What’s the Dependency? 

Have you ever planned for a party? You may have purchased ice, gone grocery shopping, 
selected music, made food, or even cleaned in preparation 
 . 
 Many times, these tasks depend  
on another task being done first 

 . 

 For instance, you wouldn’t make food before grocery  
shopping, now would you?
Let’s consider the relationship between: 

•   the number of hours worked and the money ear ned  . 

•   your grade on a test and the number of hours you studied  . 

•   the number of people working on a particular job and the time it takes to complete a job  . 

•   the number of games played and the number of points scored  . 

•   the speed of a car and how far the driver pushes down on the gas pedal  . 

Ther 

e are two quantities that are changing in each situation 

 . 

 When one quantity depends on  
another in a problem situation, it is said to be the dependent quantity 

 . 

 The quantity that the  
dependent quantity depends upon is called the independent quantity 

 . 
  

  1. 

  Cir 

cle the independent quantity and underline the dependent quantity in  
each statement 

 . 

  
  

  2. 

  Describe how you can determine which quantity is the independent quantity and which 
quantity is the dependent quantity in any pr 

oblem situation 

 . 
The independent quantity is the quantity that stands alone and is not changed by  

  
the other quantities.
The dependent quantity depends on the independent quantity. The independent 
quantity causes a change in the dependent quantity.

Smart  Phone,  but  Is  It  a  Smart  Deal? 

You have had your eye on an upgraded smart phone  .  However, you currently do not have  
the money to pur 
chase it

 Your cousin will provide the funding, as long as you pay him  
interest

 He tells you that you only need to pay $1 in interest initially, and then the interest will  
double each week after that

Can’t  Wait  to  Hit  the  Slopes! 

Andrew loves skiing—he just hates the ski lift ride back up to the top of the hill  .  For some  
r 
eason the ski lift has been acting up today  . 
 His last trip started fine 
 . 
 The ski lift traveled up  
the mountain at a steady rate of about 83 feet per minute 

 . 

 Then all of a sudden it stopped  
and Andrew sat there waiting for 10 minutes! Finally, the ski lift began to ascend up the 
mountain to the top

It’s  Magic 

The Amazing Aloysius is practicing one of his tricks  .  As part of this trick, he cuts a rope into  
many pieces and then magically puts the pieces of r 
ope back together  . 
 He begins the trick  
with a 20-foot rope and then cuts it in half 

 . 

 He then takes one of the halves and cuts that  
piece in half 

 . 

 He repeats this process until he is left with a piece so small he can no longer  
cut it 

 . 

 He wants to know how many total cuts he can make and the length of each remaining  
piece of rope after the total number of cuts 

 .

Problem  2   Matching  g raphs and Scenarios 

While a person can describe the monthly cost to operate a business, or talk about a marathon 
pace a runner ran to break a world record, graphs on a coordinate plane enable people to  see  
the data  .   

Graphs relay information about data in a visual way  .   

If you read almost any  
newspaper, especially in the business section, you will probably encounter graphs  . 

  
Points on a coordinate plane that are or are not connected with a line or smooth curve model, 
or represent, a relationship in a problem situation  .   

In some problem situations, all the points  
on the coordinate plane will make sense  .   

In other problem situations, not all the points will  
make sense  .   

So, when you model a relationship on a coordinate plane, it is up to you to  
consider the situation and interpret the meaning of the data values shown  . 
  1. 

  Cut out each graph on the following pages 

 . 

 Then, analyze each graph, match it to a  
scenario, and tape it next to the scenario it matches 

 . 

 For each graph, label the  x - and  
y -axes with the appropriate quantity and unit of measure  .  T 

hen, write the title of the  
problem situation on each graph  . 
  

  
    
What strategies  
will you use to match  
each graph with one of the  
eight scenarios?
